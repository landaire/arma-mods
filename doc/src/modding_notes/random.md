- SCR_ResourceConsumer
	- Consumes resources from a base
	- IsAllowed checks if you're allowed to consume resources
	- RequestConsumtion requests the actual resource consumption
- SCR_ResourceContainer
	- OnResourcesChanged is triggered when the resources value changes
- SCR_PlacingEditorComponent
	- Does a bunch of checks to see if a player can spawn items
	- Attaches the author to the item in `CreateEntityServer`
- SCR_CampaignBuildingPlacingEditorComponent
	- Has `IsThereEnoughBudgetToSpawnItem` and `IsThereEnoughBudgetToSpawn` which ultimately checks if the entity source  can be spawned with the known budget constraints
	- Also has `GetEntityBudgetValue` which grabs the cost of the item
- `SCR_ResourcePlayerControllerInventoryComponent::TryPerformResourceConsumption` can be overridden to hijack the result of resource consumption from a container for a player. `GetOwner()` would return the `SCR_PlayerController`

	- Can probably cast `m_ResourceGenerator` to `SCR_ResourceContainer container = SCR_ResourceContainer.Cast(actor);`
